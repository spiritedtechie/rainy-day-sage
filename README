# Weather Sage
It rains a lot here in the UK. Why not let this friendly application be your weather sage? 

It can provide you with a wise and uplifting message about the weather. Particularly useful if the weather forecast looks bad!

Converts the weather forecast data from the UK MetOffice into a human readable summary, and quotes an uplifting message in case of bad weather.

Mostly just a way for me to mess around with LLMs.
